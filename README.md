<h1> PRATHAM KRISHNA </h1>
<h5> I'm a freshman at Lovely Professional University pursuing Computer Science Engineering with the degree of B.tech(hons).<br>
I've always been keen on programming until 2021 when I could really get hands-on with development and start off with something i've always wanted to do - code for hours and     hours. <br>
A few of my other interests include Motovlogging(I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfkny3ccbpadisVQ0-k7YVQ/videos">YouTube</a> channel) , listening to music and learning and grinding on new skills.</h5>
